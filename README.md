## Notepad

Idea to have `main` as the template, while branches can be spun off (and served as sites) for separate classes.
- overridden 8/26 for convenience
- maybe "main" is the _current_ class
- issue is the URL when using github pages. you don't want jackrieger.github.io/teaching as the class site
- if you have a separate domain you could do the original idea, but maybe not worth it. keep separate repos

HTML - green
CSS - yellow
JS - blue

## Teaching activities

Lecture
Live demo
Ask class question and code what they say

## Commands

Serve the site with local config to avoid URL issues: `jekyll serve --config _config.dev.yml`
> After running this, you will need to rebuild using production settings: `jekyll build`
