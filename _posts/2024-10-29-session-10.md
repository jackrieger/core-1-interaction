## Reading Reflection & Discussion

We'll spend 20 minutes writing a reflection on the reading from last week. As you write, I'll pick out some highlights to discuss as a class.

Post your reflections here: [Reading Reflection – What is Code?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZFc4ueUMhoUiUMcjh16CQ8NPbEOnKpcbi-z-74uipso/edit?usp=sharing)

## JavaScript & the Document Object Model

Lecture

## Break

## Activity: data collection onto a webpage

Use your data collection from the previous class to create a webpage.

## Next class

Your seventh entry is due next class. You must use JavaScript, in some way, to enhance the page.

Submit the URL of your site to Canvas, like so:

`USERNAME.github.io/harmonic-collection/entry-7`
