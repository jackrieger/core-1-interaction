To create a post, add a file to your `_posts` directory with the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Use the `post_url` tag to link to other posts without having to worry about the URLs breaking when the site permalink style changes.

## Some h2 on the page

This will be linked automatically via `toc.html`
