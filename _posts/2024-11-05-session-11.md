## Lecture: JavaScript and the Document

## Break ?

## Live Coding: data collection webpage

I am going to start with a demo of creating a bookshelf with my example JSON:

Some step-based goals for myself:

```
Get the raw data to show up on the page
Get the data into HTML elements
Give the elements some style with CSS
Refine the layout of the books to reflect color and thickness
```

## Activity

Using what we just learned, use your data collection from the two classes to create a webpage.
