## TBD

## Live Coding: data collection webpage

I am going to start with a demo of creating a bookshelf with my example JSON:

```
{
  "bookshelf": [
    {
      "shelf": "Fiction",
      "books": [
        {
          "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird",
          "author": "Harper Lee",
          "color": "blue",
          "page_count": 281
        },
        {
          "title": "1984",
          "author": "George Orwell",
          "color": "gray",
          "page_count": 328
        },
        {
          "title": "The Great Gatsby",
          "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
          "color": "green",
          "page_count": 180
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "shelf": "Non-Fiction",
      "books": [
        {
          "title": "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind",
          "author": "Yuval Noah Harari",
          "color": "white",
          "page_count": 498
        },
        {
          "title": "Educated",
          "author": "Tara Westover",
          "color": "red",
          "page_count": 352
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "shelf": "Science Fiction",
      "books": [
        {
          "title": "Dune",
          "author": "Frank Herbert",
          "color": "tan",
          "page_count": 412
        },
        {
          "title": "Neuromancer",
          "author": "William Gibson",
          "color": "black",
          "page_count": 271
        },
        {
          "title": "Snow Crash",
          "author": "Neal Stephenson",
          "color": "purple",
          "page_count": 480
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Some step-based goals for myself:

```
Get the raw data to show up on the page
Get the data into HTML elements
Give the elements some style with CSS
Refine the layout of the books to reflect color and thickness
```

## Activity

Use your data collection from the previous class to create a webpage.

## Next class

Next class there is a guest lecture for you all to attend:
