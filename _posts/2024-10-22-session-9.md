## Intro to JavaScript

We're going to start JavaScript today!

[Here is the lecture …](https://jackrieger.github.io/core-2-interaction-lab/lectures/intro-to-javascript/)

## Activity: data collection

You are going to create a data collection, by hand.

Think about some collections you have. How would you represent this data in JSON format?

Some ideas (but feel free to make your own):

- A personal home library, with books that have titles, authors, page count, …
- A recent playlist you made, with information of songs, artists, playtimes, moods, …
- Your favorite movies, with directors, runtimes, ratings, …

Make it something interesting that you can work with next week, for a different activity.

Create a JSON file of your data. Then, run it through the JSON validator and come up to show me:

[https://jsonlint.com/](https://jsonlint.com/)

Bonus (if you have time):

Make this data display on a webpage.
