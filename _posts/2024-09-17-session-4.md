## Q&A

Everyone write one question you have about HTML/CSS so far, and add them here for a demo: [Core 1: Interaction - Q&A 9/17](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TRfGWjhgCqPSxKevWR8AOSbo9y9ycO1CqLrwpCe-KNI/edit?usp=sharing)

## 10-minute break

## Group share

Get into groups of 3. Show your most recent entry to your peers and talk about it. Each person not presenting should ask questions. For around five minutes, talk about the design. For another five minutes, show your code and discuss how you achieved the design.

Some prompts:

* How did you arrive at this idea for your second entry?
* Do you feel like this theme will carry you for the whole semester?
* How did you execute this idea in code?

## CSS Typography

Adding fonts to your site can happen a number of ways. We will discuss a few!

## Next class

Your third entry is due next class.

Submit the URL of your site to Canvas, like so:

`USERNAME.github.io/harmonic-collection/entry-3`

Additionally, I would like you to read [_A Vernacular Web_](https://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/), by Olia Lialina. Come prepared to discuss this at the beginning of next class.
