## Theme Presentations

Let's have a look at your theme presentations, in this order: Shreya, Antara, Wei Ki, Elle, Zoe, Jeremiah, Blossom, Icey, Gabriella, Jason, Aina, Krishna, Pie, Iclal, Aiya

To give a fair amount of time to everyone, you will have 5 minutes to present.

## 10-minute break

## Intro to HTML

Today's lecture is an intro to HTML.

## Hello, World

We will go over setting up your (presumably) first HTML file, and setting up your site with it.

## Are.na

Are.na is a great platform to look at and collect your own reference material. For instance, here's a great collection of sites that utilize basic HTML:

[https://www.are.na/html-energy/html-day](https://www.are.na/html-energy/html-day)

## Next class

Your first entry is due next class. You can only use HTML for this entry. Submit the URL of your site to Canvas, like so:

`USERNAME.github.io/harmonic-collection/entry-1`
