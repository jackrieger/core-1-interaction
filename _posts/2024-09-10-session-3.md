## Entry Presentations

Let's have a look at your first entries, in this order: Aiya, Iclal, Pie, Krishna, Aina, Jason, Gabriella, Icey, Blossom, Jeremiah, Zoe, Elle, Wei Ki, Antara, Shreya.

We won't have presentations every class, but your first entry is nice to show. To give a fair amount of time to everyone, you will have 3 minutes to show.

I want to know:

- the general idea
- 1 thing you found easy
- 1 thing you found confusing

## 10-minute break

## Q&A

Based on what you all just shared, I will answer a few common questions.

## Intro to CSS

Today's lecture is an intro to CSS.

## Next class

Your second entry is due next class. This time, you can use CSS.

For what it's worth, I decided to add some examples of previous assignments on the Project page if you want to reference how each entry varies week by week, but still relates to your common theme.

Submit the URL of your site to Canvas, like so:
