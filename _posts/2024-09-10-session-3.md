## Entry Presentations

Let's have a look at your first entries, in this order: Aiya, Iclal, Pie, Krishna, Aina, Jason, Gabriella, Icey, Blossom, Jeremiah, Zoe, Elle, Wei Ki, Antara, Shreya.

We won't have presentations every class, but your first entry is nice to show. To give a fair amount of time to everyone, you will have 3 minutes to show.

I want to know:

- the general idea
- 1 thing you found easy
- 1 thing you found confusing

## 10-minute break

## Q&A

Based on what you all just shared, I will answer a few common questions.

## Intro to CSS

Today's lecture is an intro to CSS.

## Next class

Your second entry is due next class. This time, you can use CSS.

Submit the URL of your site to Canvas, like so:
