## Introductions

Welcome to Core Interaction! Let's get to know each other a bit better:

- Your name
- Where you're from (city and country)
- An interest of yours outside of design
- The last thing you searched on Wikipedia and why

## Syllabus

We're going to go over the syllabus for this course. Please stop me if you have questions! You can download it [here]({{ "docs/PUCD_2035_D_RIEGER_F24.pdf" | relative_url }}) or find it in Canvas.

## Harmonic collection

All sections of this class have the same project – the [Harmonic Collection]({{ "/project" | relative_url }}). It is a collection of ten entries that will together create a website.

## GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a platform that allows us to create, store, manage, and share code. We will host our projects on it. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a service offered by GitHub that enables the hosting of a website, from the code that you have in your [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories).

This part of the class is often frustrating for those new to code. I will try to make it as easy as possible, by using a template.

Here's what we're going to do, in order to be set up for the semester:

- Sign up for an account here: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
- Make a copy of the template repository: [https://github.com/jackrieger/harmonic-collection](https://github.com/jackrieger/harmonic-collection)
  - Look for "Use this template" in upper right corner
  - Create a new repository
  - For the repository name (exactly the same, with no change in capitalization, spaces, or other):  `harmonic-collection`
  - Public setting
  - Create Repository
- Create a [Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) on your copy of the repository
- Enable settings for live site hosting
  - Settings > Pages > Branch: `main` > Save
  - Go back to repository > About > Website > Check "Use your GitHub Pages website"
- Come up to me and show me that the site is live and working

## Next class

Come to class with three ideas for your Harmonic Collection’s theme. This can be created in Figma, InDesign, or Google Slides. Export a PDF and be ready to be share at the start of next class.

Your presentation should include (for each idea):

- 1 slide that explains the idea generally and visually
- 1 slide that explains why you’re interested in the idea
- 2 or 3 additional slides that highlight some visual examples of sketches, inspiration, ideas, or other websites you like
