## In-class work session

We will spend the class revising and polishing our websites for the final review. 

I want to meet personally with everyone for at least 5 minutes to see your latest entries and the sites as a whole.

## Next class

Next week is your final critique. We will have a guest:

[Victor Guan](https://victorguan.com/)

Everyone will have 9 minutes for the entire presentation and feedback. As a reminder, [here are the requirements for the project as a whole]({{ "project/" | relative_url }}). What and how you show your project is up to you, but you will be showing the website only and not slide presentations.
