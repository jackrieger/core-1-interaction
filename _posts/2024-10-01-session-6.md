## Reading Reflection

At the top of class, we'll spend 20 minutes writing a reflection on the reading from last week. As you write, I'll pick out some highlights to discuss as a class.

Post your reflections here: [Reading Reflection – A Vernacular Web](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hscOFYlMpnt7Vr-VUmVh13dY1K0YJq07H8YAP-uxH14/edit?usp=sharing)

## Site Browsing

We're going to explore some sites and talk about them. When you're visiting any site, here are some guiding questions to ask yourself about the experience:

- What is the purpose of this site? How is that conveyed?
- What are the main areas of the site? What features does the site have?
- How does this site make you feel? Do you think it was made for a specific audience?
- What era of web design is this from? What’s telling you that?
- What’s the navigation? Is it clear? Are there multiple ways to navigate?
- What kind of space does this site feel like?
