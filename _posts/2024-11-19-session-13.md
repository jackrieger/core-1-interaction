## Q&A Demo

Everyone write a code question! Or a website design question. I'll answer them all: [Q&A â€“ Nov 19](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M64XJ9qFglP3RI0xsQ70qNzpz2aXkaIQdRr9VpNBZR8/edit?usp=sharing)

## Lecture: libraries

Libraries are fun! Let's talk about how to approach integrating them into your project: [Libraries](https://jackrieger.github.io/core-2-interaction-lab/lectures/libraries/)

## Activity: p5.js

[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) is a great library for creative coding. Let's have a look and see how you parse a library's documentation, as well as get to making something with it.

## Next class

Next class will be an open workshop to polish your sites for the final review on Dec 3rd.

Do entry 10! Try to use a library if it makes sense for your project.
